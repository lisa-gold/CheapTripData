Today, I'm excited to share with you my latest discovery: Den Gamle By in Aarhus, Denmark.\nDen Gamle By, which translates to \"The Old Town,\" is a living museum that takes you back in time to the 19th century. It's like stepping into a time machine, but without the hefty price tag. As a budget traveller, I'm always on the lookout for affordable attractions, and Den Gamle By definitely fits the bill.\nThe museum features over 75 historical buildings that have been meticulously restored and furnished to reflect life in Denmark during the 1800s. You can wander through the cobblestone streets and explore the homes, shops, and workshops of the past. It's a fascinating glimpse into Danish history and culture, and it won't break the bank.\nOne of my favourite parts of Den Gamle By is the staff. They're all dressed in period costumes and are incredibly knowledgeable about the history of the town. They're happy to answer any questions you have and even demonstrate traditional crafts and trades. It's like having your own personal tour guide, but without the added cost.\nAnother great thing about Den Gamle By is that it's located in Aarhus, Denmark's second-largest city. Aarhus is a vibrant and youthful city with plenty of affordable accommodation options, from hostels to budget hotels. Plus, there are plenty of cheap eats and drinks to be found in the city's many cafes and bars.\nSo, if you're looking for an affordable and unique experience in Denmark, look no further than Den Gamle By in Aarhus. It's a trip back in time that won't break the bank.",
